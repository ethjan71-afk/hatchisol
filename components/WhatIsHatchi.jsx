          Hatchi was a real dog a fluffy, two-year-old Chow Chow who filled our lives with pure joy, loyalty, 
          and endless love.On January 6, 2026, just days after the New Year, Hatchi suddenly became weak.
           He slowly lost his appetite, and despite everything we did to help him, he peacefully passed away. 
           Losing him at such a young age broke our hearts in ways we can barely describe. He was more than a pet he was family, 
           our constant companion, and the light of our home.The pain of his loss was overwhelming,
            but it also reminded us how deeply he had touched our lives. Because of that love and that heartbreak,
             we decided to create $HATCHI — a memecoin born from real emotion, not just hype.
              This project is our way of keeping Hatchi's memory alive forever. Through this coin, his spirit of loyalty, joy,
               and unconditional love continues on — in a community, in a movement,
                and hopefully in something that can bring happiness to many others, just like he did for us.
                 Hatchi may have gone to heaven, 
          but he will never truly leave us. He is the heart and soul behind $HATCHI.
